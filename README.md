# Employee-Turnover-Predictor

This repository contains a Python script for predicting employee turnover based on various features. The script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and trains a logistic regression and random forest model for prediction. The trained model can be used to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company or not.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn


## File Description
employee_turnover_predictor.py: The main Python script that performs data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.
hr_data.csv: The HR data file containing the employee information and target variable (whether an employee left or stayed).
model.pkl: The trained model saved in pickle format.

## Acknowledgements
The script is inspired by the problem of employee turnover prediction in HR analytics. The analysis and modeling techniques used in the script are based on best practices in data science and machine learning.
